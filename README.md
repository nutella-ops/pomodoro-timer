# Pomodoro Timer
*Short Story:*
    I made my own Pomodoro Timer beacuse it wasn't difficult and I wanted a timer that didn't rely on an internet connection (i.e. the widely avaliable website-based timers). 

*Long Story:*
    I wanted the above description and I was in a hurry to use the timer immediately. I had to generate the audio in code because I didn't have a convenient way to create a sine wave audio file, which was my initial thought. I didn't have previous experience generating audio in code so I found a sine wave audio example online and coded the alarm sound, user interface, and time keeping. I think it took about 1-3 hours.

*Future Plans:*
    I'd like to add functionality that optionally allows automatically logging time to a file corresponding to the task being worked on. A friend said the sine wave sounded like a numbers station. In that spirit, I cut up actual numbers station audio so now the timer "speaks" the time elapsed.
